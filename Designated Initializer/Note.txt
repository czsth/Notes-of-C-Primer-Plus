Designated initializer is a new characteristic in C99, used to desinate a value for a specific position in an array.
As usual, position that was not designated with a value will be filled with 0.
Also, if mixed with normal initializer, for example, assigned twice: the final value will be the latter.

Caution: if code:
```
int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, [4] = 4, 5};
```
The value will be:
0.1
1.2
2.3
3.0
4.4
5.5
And the size of the array is 6.
